				<p>Remote work is great for so many reasons. You get to work from wherever you want,
you don’t have to commute to the office and get stuck in traffic. It is great if
you want to travel the world and work at the same time. It is great if you have
kids to take care of and parents to help at home. You don’t have to move to a
different city. And many other such wonderful things. I enjoyed my time as a remote
developer and still do.</p>
<p>But just like everything else, it too has problems.  I will only talk about the
problems of doing remote work from India, because that’s what I am most familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of Employment</li>
</ul>
<p>Most remote developers working for an offshore company are not officially employees
of that company. Developers charge them monthly invoices. The company cannot provide
developers monthly pay slips, form 16 or employee benefits. At my age, couldn’t care
less about employee benefits (I should though), but I do care about pay slips. For
most traditional institutions, pay slip is the proof that you have a steady source of
income. Without that you fall into the category of self-employed. You can show your
contract with the company and recurring transactions of income, but that won’t work.
Pay slips are just too straightforward  and easy for them, they just don’t want to deal
with anything else.
Try applying for a credit card without a payslip. You will either have to wait until
you file multiple Income Tax Returns or maintain good balance for a reasonable time.
And still your credit limit will be much lower than someone earning the same amount,
but has a pay slip. For my visa applications, I had to highlight multiple transactions
in my bank statements, provide certificates for my business entity, a copy of my really
long consulting contract. Which government officer wants put efforts in going through
all that? They would be happy to serve someone with a payslip and choose to avoid you
who is confusing them with so much paperwork. A huge number of Indian professionals
are first generation of office-goers in their family. They don’t have many proofs to
show their financial stability. In that way, a pay slip, I think, would matter more
than it does in other countries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visas</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote developers would need to travel offshore to meet their colleagues. I have wasted
a considerable amount of time preparing my visa applications. If I had someone to handle
that for me, I would have been a much happier developer and put more of my time in doing
software development.
As far as I know, most MNCs in Bangalore, handle visa for their employees. I can’t
expect a remote-first offshore company to do my visas for me, especially if it is small,
which almost all of them are. They don’t know how to deal with this problem any better
than you do. And honestly, doing this may be sub-optimal use of their time and it is better
spent on something else productive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling taxes myself</li>
</ul>
<p>It is sub-optimal use of my time. My time is best spent on software development. By now I
know a lot about taxing than what I did a year ago, more than some local CAs. Which is not
a complement on me, but a remark on many CAs.
Finding a good CA is tough. Finding the one you can trust is even tougher. I had to
cross-verify things they were saying and often times, what they were saying would be wrong.
Often instead of them giving me ideas on how to save taxes, I had to tell them and they nod
yes. One of them had this grand idea of making me pay 35% tax (30% is max tax for the highest
slab). I think I have finally found the right CA.
But given the option, I would have chosen to learn none these and would have delegated this
to someone else.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loneliness</li>
</ul>
<p>When you go to the office, you can make friends, talk to people and maintain your sanity.
Sitting at home with no one to talk to, you get bored and insane. It could make sense for
someone with the family, but that’s not the case here. A large chunk of Indian developers
are in their 20s, avoiding marriage. Plus most of them are living in metros, far away from
their hometown. So, your office circle is your primary social circle. They can try to go
back to their hometown, but that place would not have good facilities and other developer
peers.
You could try going to some coworking space, but they are simply put useless. The problem
with today’s offices is that they are so open, noisy, distracting and everyone just keep
pulling each other into their solving their problems. I would be surprised if any real work
gets done in a coworking space, because they are not optimized for productivity and
<code>collaboration</code>.
But why do you care, you want to go there to socialize anyway. Problem is that most of the
coworking spaces are  occupied by startup teams. They have their own circle and not need to
socialize with other.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unreliable Internet</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of all the problems, this one can be most easily addressed. I had two wired internet
connections (Spectra and Airtel). Sadly, there was metro construction outside my society.
Most of India is developing rapidly. This is the story of almost everywhere. Construction
is going on everywhere from metros to villages. Because of that they would break cable every
few days. I have attended quite a few meetings on relatively slow wireless internet.
Interestingly, my society was inside a tech park. They surely don’t have internet outages.
Companies have separate connections that goes deeper and doesn’t get broken easily. Only if
I could get that connection for my apartment!</p>
<ul>
<li>No office</li>
</ul>
<p>I know complaining about not having an office is so not remote-like. This is a problem
nonetheless.
Like it or not, but staying at home and working is not easy. I have weights and ropes in
my room right next to my table, but I rarely use them. I end up doing more exercise when
I wear my shoes and get out of my house at 6 in the morning. Most human habits are based
on rituals. Going to office is a ritual that gives you a mental switch and ensures that
you will work. Waking up early is the ritual. If you do it, you are much more likely to
exercise. With a home office, it is difficult to balance work and life.
Plus, most indian households are noisy, chaotic, sudden guests and in general not a great
place to work. If you stay at home, someone will ring the doorbell, you will have to take
your dog to pee, attend the electrician, give your brother’s friend his book back and many
other small tasks just enough to stop you from long stretch of focussed work.</p>
<p>I think most of these are problems for the companies as well, since these things make their
developers less productive. And fixing them will make more developers open to remote working.
I am trying to solve some of these problems with remote91.in. Check it out and get in touch
to solve them for your company.</p>
