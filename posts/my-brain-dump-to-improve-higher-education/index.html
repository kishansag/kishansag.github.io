				<p>These are my notes when I was thinking on how can I build to a college of my dreams.
I don&rsquo;t know when I will be able to do it, since</p>
<ul>

<p>So, I am putting all of my raw thoughts here, so if someone with superpowers ever
gets lost on this corner of the internet, there is a tiny chance that this will
become a reality.
