    <p>These are my notes when I was thinking on how can I build to a college of my dreams.
I don&rsquo;t know when I will be able to do it, since</p>
<ul>
<li>it will definitely require funding,</li>
<li>it would take really long time to make a different kind of college mainstream,</li>
<li>amount of money to be made are probably not justifiable with the efforts that
anyone will have to put.  I will feel as if I am doing a disservice if I try to
the society squeeze more money</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I am putting all of my raw thoughts here, so if someone with superpowers ever
gets lost on this corner of the internet, there is a tiny chance that this will
become a reality.
