    <p>Any business where the interests of consumer and producer are not aligned, is
begging to be disrupted.</p>
<p>A mutual fund house is not sufficiently incentivized to grow money invested in the
fund. It is not their money. People working in finance can make more money by sales,
than making your product better. You make more money by selling your mutual fund
units than making better investment decisions using existing cash. It takes years
to determine whether a investment decision is right or not. An employee working in
a finance company wants promotion. How can the management determine which employee
is better? How can an employee impress their boss? Sales. Just sales. Interest of
Fund manager and an individual who invested in the fund are not aligned. If 50% of
the money is invested by the fund itself, investment decisions would be significantly
different.</p>
<p>A real estate agent can make more money by selling you a shitty house at high price
than selling you a good house and lower price. They don&rsquo;t have to care about customer
satisfaction, because customers are not recurring. People buy houses only few times in
their lifetime. Interests are not aligned.</p>
<p>A university can make more money by selling you their shitty program at high price
than actually finding what will help you the most with your career. Customers are not
recurring here and it will take years to determine the true value of your education.
Interests are not aligned here. Universities are more incentivized to sell than
actually delivering customer utility.</p>
<p>Private universities are in the same league as an investment house and real estate.</p>
