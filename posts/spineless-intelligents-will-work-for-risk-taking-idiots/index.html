    <p>In a world full of so many opportunities, where a poor person has all the valuable
information at their disposle to make their life better, intelligent and hard-working
people are abundant.</p>
<p>In the working world, there are basically two kinds of people, enterpreneurs and
investor.</p>
<p>Enterpreneurs do all sorts of unconventional things to get users and
create hype for whatever they are doing. A significant number of them are scams,
dillusional and are trying to do things in which they have no expertise, but they
will claim to have expertise in them.</p>
<p>Investor are of two types, ex-enterpreneurs who made a lot of money and people
from fancy colleges. An enterpreneur-turned-investor who created a company in
a specific sub-industry is an expert in the product that they built and customers
of their product. Their knowledge is very much in this very specific area and
questionable in everything else. But because they became successful in that, they
somehow start thinking that they know about other things too. Very few people
try to show them the reality that they are not expert in other things, because
they are successful. They make mistakes of investing in companies  and industries
which they know very little about. They end up investing in companies than can put
on a show.</p>
<p>A guy-from-fancy-college investor doesn&rsquo;t care if his/her investment choices are
good or not, because a) it is not his money and b) 6 years from now when returns
of those investment would come he would be working at some other firm. He knows
nothing about how that AI company can different between human and cat and how
that new cryptocurrency algorithm is even valid. He is interested in investing
in companies that can create great buzz so that he can get a promotion or a better
job. They too invest in companies that can put on a show.</p>
<p>Everytime I go see what new opportunities are there in the market, I see shitty
companies about which I can tell that their product is not going to move a needle.
But I have to think about applying there, because they have got huge funding and
pay great salaries.</p>
<p>Intelligent people who take calculated risks go a long way, mostly because there
are so few.</p>
